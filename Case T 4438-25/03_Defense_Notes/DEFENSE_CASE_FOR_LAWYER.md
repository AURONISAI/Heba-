# 🛡️ DEFENSE CASE FILE - T 4438-25
## Mohammad Sami Alsharef & Joumana Alnablsi v. Heba Alhussien
### CONFIDENTIAL - FOR DEFENSE LAWYER USE ONLY

---

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**This is NOT a debt case. This is a REVENGE lawsuit.**

The plaintiff (Heba Alhussien) was running an informal money transfer business (hawala-style) between Sweden and Syria. The money she claims as "loans" was actually:
1. **Family money cycling** through her as an intermediary
2. **Her payments** that were repaid in Damascus to her family
3. **Business transactions** where SHE ended up owing the defendants

**Critical Evidence:**
- ✅ WhatsApp message (Dec 29, 2024): Heba WROTE "عليي سداد دين لابو سمير 35 الف كرون" = **"I owe Abu Sami a debt of 35,000 kr"**
- ✅ She filed a FALSE RAPE ACCUSATION that police dismissed in ~10 days for lack of evidence
- ✅ Lawsuit filed AFTER defendant blocked her (Feb 22, 2025)
- ✅ Money came from COMPANIES (witnesses available) not personal funds

---

# PART 1: THE TRUE STORY

## 1.1 Background Relationship
- Heba Alhussien was a family friend who ran informal money transfers (hawala) from Syria, Afghanistan, and Iraq
- She helped families send money between Sweden and Damascus
- She became close to the family, visiting often and helping with daily tasks

## 1.2 How Hawala Works
```
SWEDEN SIDE:                        DAMASCUS SIDE:
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
[Sami receives money] ───→ [Sami pays equivalent in Damascus to Heba's father]
                                    ↓
[Heba sends to Sami]  ←─── [Father's friend sends to Heba's account]
                                    ↓
[Cycle repeats]        ←─── [Same money circles back]
```

**The 300,000 kr the plaintiff claims as "loans" was the SAME money cycling 3 times!**

## 1.3 The Business Reality
- Heba was paying Sami's Swedish bills (Kronofogden, Klarna, Bank Norwegian, etc.)
- Sami was paying her family in Damascus with equivalent amounts
- This was NOT lending - it was a **money transfer service**

---

# PART 2: EVIDENCE BREAKDOWN

## 2.1 🔴 SMOKING GUN - Heba's Debt Acknowledgment

**Date:** December 29, 2024
**Source:** WhatsApp chat
**Quote (Arabic):**
> "عليي سداد دين لابو سمير 35 الف كرون . لتاريخ اليوم بشهر ديسمبر وتم دفع الرينتا من ابو سمير كاش 1800 كرون ل هبه"

**Translation:**
> "I owe Abu Sami a debt of 35,000 kr. As of today in December, and rent was paid by Abu Sami cash 1,800 kr to Heba"

**THIS PROVES SHE OWED THEM MONEY - NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND!**

## 2.2 Payment Records Showing Mutual Business

### Heba Paying Sami's Bills (2023):
| Date | Amount | Description | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| June 7, 2023 | 49,615 kr | Kronofogden | "حساب ابو سمير" |
| June 7, 2023 | 10,459 kr | Klarna | Business accounting |
| June 8, 2023 | 28,000 kr | Klarna | "سددت الي انت طالبتني ياها" |
| June 9, 2023 | 25,011 kr | Klarna | Part of cycling |
| June 10, 2023 | 7,350 kr | Bank Norwegian | Her bank, his debt |
| June 10, 2023 | 3,000 kr | Linas Matkasse | Household expense |

### The Account Balance (June 2023):
> "حساب ابو سمير ٨٨٥٢ دولار" = "Abu Sami's account: $8,852"

**This shows SHE owed HIM $8,852 at that point!**

## 2.3 The 35,000 kr Transfer (Sept 17, 2024)

**Context:** Sami asked Heba to transfer 35,000 from her Bank Norwegian to his Nordea account

**WhatsApp Exchange:**
```
Sami: "فوتي حوليلي من النوريجين تبعك فورا 35000 kr لحسابي"
      (Transfer 35,000 from YOUR Bank Norwegian to MY account immediately)

Sami: "3086 00 59626" (His Nordea account)

Heba: "اكتبلك gåva ?" (Should I write 'gift'?)

Sami: "لا لا" (No no)
      "Lån" (Write 'loan')

Heba: "قرض قصدك مو ؟!" (You mean loan?!)

Sami: "اي دين" (Yes, debt)
```

**CRITICAL:** The word "Lån" was used for ACCOUNTING PURPOSES in the bank transfer - NOT because it was an actual loan. This was HER money coming back to him as part of the cycling arrangement!

## 2.4 The 100,000 kr Transfer (Sept-Oct 2024)

**Sept 30, 2024:**
```
Sami: "ادفعيلي ال ١٠٠ من عندك بالله على حسابي فورا واكتبي lån"
      (Pay me the 100 from yours to my account immediately and write 'lån')

Heba: "حوللك 95727 ?" (Should I transfer 95,727?)
```

**Oct 23, 2024:**
```
Sami: "دفعتلك 102023 بس يوصلوكي اكديلي"
      (I paid you 102,023, confirm when you receive it)

Heba: "كيف عليي ٦٠ الف" 
      "شوووو الك عليي ٦٠ الف ؟ كيف"
      (How do I owe 60,000? What?! You're saying I owe you 60,000? How?)
```

**This shows Sami was PAYING HER and she owed HIM 60,000!**

## 2.5 The Final Conversation & Block (Feb 2025)

**Feb 17, 2025 - The Warning:**
```
Sami: "أنا نبهتك بالحكي بالهدوء أنت شكلك ما فهمت بالحكي بالهدوء هلا شوفي الوش الثاني بقى"
      (I warned you calmly, you didn't understand. Now see the other side)
```

**Feb 22, 2025 - Heba's Desperation:**
```
Heba: "أنا بشو غلطت معك" (What did I do wrong?)
      "شو حاكيلا ل جمانة عني" (What did you tell Joumana about me?)
      "أنا مو كنت اعمل متل ما تقلي" (Wasn't I doing what you asked?)
```

**Then: "You blocked this contact"**

**TIMELINE:** Blocked Feb 22, 2025 → Lawsuit filed shortly after = REVENGE

---

# PART 3: FALSE RAPE ACCUSATION

## 3.1 The Police Report

**Allegation:** Heba filed a police report claiming Mohammad Sami Alsharef raped her multiple times over 2 years

**Outcome:** Police dismissed the case in approximately 10 days due to complete lack of evidence

**Significance:**
1. This shows a **pattern of false accusations**
2. Establishes **revenge motive** - when her romantic advances were rejected
3. Proves **willingness to make serious false claims**

**REQUEST FOR LAWYER:**
- Obtain police report dismissal documentation
- File reference number needed
- This can be used to establish plaintiff's credibility issues

---

**Plaintiff's Story:** Gave Sami 240,000 kr cash in three payments

**Defense Response:**
- This was NOT a loan - it was payment in the hawala cycling
- The money came from COMPANIES (not her personal funds)
- Evidence: "في حسابها المصاري جاييها من شركات" (in her bank account, money came from companies)
- These companies can TESTIFY the money was for Mohammad, not from Heba personally

- Testimony from transferring companies
- Damascus payment records to Heba's father

## 4.2 Claim: 30,000 kr to Joumana (Jan 2023)

**Defense Response:**
- Part of the money transfer business
- Jan 2023 WhatsApp shows: "ربي يسلم ايديكي مبدائيا رجعتلك كل شي اخذتو منك سويش"
  (God bless your hands, initially I returned everything I took from you via Swish)
- This was REPAID immediately!

## 4.3 Claim: Bank Norwegian loan 107,875 kr

**Plaintiff's Story:** Took a loan in her name for defendants

**Defense Response:**
- "First time I heard about Bank Norwegian loan is TODAY" - Mohammad
- Multiple references in chat to "البنك النرويجي تبعك" = "YOUR Bank Norwegian"
- This was HER existing bank account/loan that she used for business
- Defendants never received money from any loan taken for them

**Evidence from WhatsApp:**
- June 2023: She pays Bank Norwegian: "تبع البنك نورجيان 7350" (Bank Norwegian 7350)
- Sept 2024: "حوليلي من النوريجين تبعك" (Transfer from YOUR Norwegian)
- This was always described as HER account

## 4.4 Claim: 100,000 kr via Marginalen Bank

**Plaintiff's Story:** Took 100,000 kr Marginalen loan for defendants

**Defense Response:**
- May 2024 chat shows Heba asking about loan: "هدول ١٠٠ الف وصلو؟" (Did the 100k arrive?)
- This was discussed as a BUSINESS arrangement
- Part of the cycling - money moved back and forth
- Oct 2024: Mohammad paid 102,023 kr BACK to her

## 4.5 Claim: Handwritten acknowledgment from Mohammad

**Plaintiff's Story:** Mohammad signed acknowledging 230,000 kr debt

**Defense Response:**
- This note was related to helping Heba convert money to cryptocurrency
- Heba was "selling them in Sweden for 20% extra taking black money from someone selling drugs"
- Context was crypto trading business, NOT personal loan

---

# PART 5: WITNESSES & EVIDENCE TO OBTAIN

## 5.1 Critical Witnesses

| Witness | Relationship | Can Testify To |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Transfer Companies | Sent money to Heba | Money was FOR Mohammad, not FROM Heba |
| Heba's Father (Damascus) | Received Damascus payments | Mohammad paid him equivalents |
| Kanan (Heba's husband) | Heba's ex-partner | Business arrangement, payments received |
| Family members | Observed relationship | Nature of hawala business |

## 5.2 Documents to Obtain

1. **Police Report Dismissal**
   - Proves false rape accusation
   - Establishes pattern of revenge

2. **Heba's Bank Statements**
   - Show company transfers TO her
   - Prove money wasn't hers

---

# PART 6: DEFENSE STRATEGY

## 6.1 Primary Defense: NO LOAN EXISTS

**Argument:** The entire financial relationship was a hawala money transfer business, not lending.

**Key Points:**
1. Money came FROM companies, not Heba personally
2. Same money cycled multiple times
3. Mutual accounting shows SHE owed THEM
4. Her Dec 2024 admission: "I owe Abu Sami 35,000 kr"

## 6.2 Secondary Defense: FULL REPAYMENT

**Argument:** Even if characterized as loans, all amounts were repaid through Damascus payments.

**Key Points:**
1. Payments to father in Damascus = repayment
2. Multiple WhatsApp references to settled accounts
3. Jan 2023: "رجعتلك كل شي" (I returned everything)

## 6.3 Tertiary Defense: COUNTERCLAIM

**Argument:** Heba owes the defendants money.

**Amounts Owed by Heba:**
- Dec 2024 admission: 35,000 kr
- Oct 2024: 60,000 kr mentioned
- Various unpaid cycling amounts

**Potential Counterclaim:** File against Heba for outstanding debts

## 6.4 Credibility Attack

**Argument:** Plaintiff has proven pattern of false accusations.

**Points:**
1. False rape accusation dismissed by police
2. Lawsuit filed immediately after being blocked = revenge
3. Relationship ended badly after romantic rejection

---

# PART 7: LEGAL ARGUMENTS

## 7.1 Burden of Proof

**Swedish Law:** Plaintiff must prove:
1. Money was transferred
2. Transfer was a LOAN (not business/hawala)
3. Repayment was agreed and not made

**Defense Position:**
- Even if transfers proven, PURPOSE was business not loan
- Repayment happened in Damascus
- No meeting of minds for loan agreement

## 7.2 Witness Credibility

**Case Law:** Courts can discount testimony from witnesses with:
- Pattern of false accusations
- Personal revenge motive
- Inconsistent statements

**Application:**
- False rape accusation = pattern of false claims
- Lawsuit after blocking = revenge motive
- WhatsApp shows debt flowing OTHER direction

## 7.3 Documentary Evidence

**Plaintiff's Evidence:**
- Bank transfers - exist but purpose disputed
- Handwritten note - context was crypto business
- Text messages - need to see if cherry-picked

**Defense Evidence:**
- WhatsApp showing SHE owed THEM money
- WhatsApp showing business relationship
- Police dismissal of rape accusation

---

# PART 8: RESPONSE TO COURT

## 8.1 Recommended Response

The defendants should DENY all claims and provide the following response:

1. **General Denial:** No loan relationship existed
2. **Alternative Characterization:** Hawala business arrangement
3. **Counterclaim:** Plaintiff owes defendants money
4. **Credibility Challenge:** Pattern of false accusations

## 8.2 Key Points for Written Response

> "The plaintiff was operating an informal money transfer business (hawala) between Sweden and Syria. The defendants were participants in this business, not borrowers. All money that moved between parties was cycling as part of this business. In fact, the plaintiff still owes the defendants money, as evidenced by her own WhatsApp message from December 29, 2024 stating 'I owe Abu Sami a debt of 35,000 kr.' The lawsuit was filed as revenge after the first defendant rejected plaintiff's romantic advances and blocked her. The plaintiff previously filed a false rape accusation against the first defendant that police dismissed within 10 days. This lawsuit is a continuation of that pattern of false accusations."
