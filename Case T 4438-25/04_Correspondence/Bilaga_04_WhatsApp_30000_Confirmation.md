## 🔴 DEFENSE NOTES

### This Confirms:
1. 30,000 SEK went to JOUMANA's account, not Mohammad's
2. Makes Joumana directly liable for this amount if it was a loan
3. Heba confirms she knows money is going to Joumana

### Defense Points:
- Clear that Joumana received this money personally
- Not Mohammad's debt for this portion
- But both are being sued jointly (solidariskt)
