## 🔴 DEFENSE NOTES - CRITICAL

### Why This Is Very Problematic:

2. This is clear documentation that it was labeled as a loan
3. Account 30860059626 - whose account is this?

### Defense Questions:
1. **Who entered the message "Lån"?** Was it Heba or was she instructed?
2. **Whose bank account is 30860059626?** Is this Mohammad's account?
3. **What was the actual purpose?** Was it truly a loan or an investment?
