## Translation of Sami's Response

**Arabic:** اي على راسي بس ارجع بدفعلك منها دفعه لا تاكلي هم

**Translation:** "Yes, certainly/at your service. Once I return, I'll pay an installment for it. Don't worry"

## 🔴 DEFENSE NOTES - CRITICAL

### Why This Is Very Problematic:
1. Mohammad explicitly says he will "**pay an installment**" (دفعه/dafwe)
2. Uses phrase "على راسي" (at your service/I'll take care of it)
3. Acknowledges the invoice is his responsibility
4. This is strong evidence of accepting debt obligation

### Defense Questions:
1. **What invoice was this exactly?**
2. **Was this related to a joint business or investment?**
3. **Context matters** - was this about loan repayment or business expense?

### Possible Defense Angles:
- If this was a business partnership, invoices might be shared expenses
- Need to understand what the invoice was for
- "Installment" suggests ongoing arrangement, not denial of obligation
