## 🔴 DEFENSE NOTES

### Key Points:
1. Reference to "they arrived" - what arrived? Goods? Money?
2. "Things are moving" - suggests business/investment activity
3. Payment to Joumana's account - this is the 30,000 SEK
4. Account is Bank Norwegian credit card account

### Questions:
- What was "arriving around 1 AM"?
- What "things are moving" refers to?
- Was this a business transaction or personal loan?
