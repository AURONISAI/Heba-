## 🔴 DEFENSE NOTES - CRITICAL

### Why This Is Problematic:
1. This appears to be an acknowledgment of amounts owed
2. The phrase "bara den som gäller" = "only this one applies"
3. Specific amounts are circled/highlighted
4. This can be interpreted as a debt acknowledgment

### Defense Questions:
1. **Who wrote this note?** Was it Mohammad or someone else?
2. **What is the context?** Is this a calculation for something else?
3. **Is this a business accounting document?** Investment tracking?
4. **Was this actually an acknowledgment of debt or a calculation of investments?**

### Important Discrepancy:
- Note says: 363,729 SEK
- Lawsuit claims: 350,395 SEK (from Marginalen loan)
- Difference: ~13,334 SEK - where does this come from?

### The 348,810 SEK matches:
- Revolut outflow in Bilaga 2: 348,810.00 SEK
- This suggests it's tracking the Revolut transfers, not a separate acknowledgment
