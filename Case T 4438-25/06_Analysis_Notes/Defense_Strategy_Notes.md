## POTENTIAL DEFENSE ARGUMENTS

### 1. Investment/Business Partnership Defense
**Argument:** Money was not a loan but investment in joint business venture

**Supporting facts:**
- Plaintiff mentions Mohammad called her "affärspartner i börsen" (business partner in stocks)
- Money went to "Revolut Digital Assets" (cryptocurrency)
- Mohammad has clothing business (samisjacket.com)
- No formal loan agreement exists

**Weakness:** The handwritten note and "Lån" transfer label work against this

---

### 2. No Written Loan Agreement
**Argument:** Without formal loan agreement, terms are unclear

**Supporting facts:**
- No skuldebrev (promissory note) was ever signed
- Plaintiff admits Mohammad refused to sign (Page 5, §3.9)
- All evidence is informal conversations

**Weakness:** Verbal loans are still enforceable in Sweden

---

### 3. Dispute Specific Amounts
**Argument:** The claimed amounts don't match the evidence

**Discrepancies found:**
- Handwritten note: 363,729 SEK
- Lawsuit claim: 350,395 SEK
- Difference: ~13,334 SEK unexplained

**Action:** Request itemized breakdown of claimed amounts

---

### 4. Joint Liability Challenge
**Argument:** Not all money went to Mohammad

**Supporting facts:**
- 30,000 SEK went directly to Joumana's account
- Should liability be split?
- Were they acting together or separately?

---

### 5. Repayment Terms Dispute
**Argument:** The repayment dates are fabricated

**Questions:**
- Where is proof of "May 31, 2024" deadline?
- No written agreement on deadlines
- Plaintiff's lawyer stated this in Page 11 without evidence

---

## PROBLEMATIC EVIDENCE TO ADDRESS

### The Handwritten Note (Bilaga 3)
- Shows specific calculation
- "Bara den som gäller" = acknowledgment
- **Defense angle:** This was accounting of investment, not debt acknowledgment

### The "Lån" Transfer (Bilaga 5)
- Transfer message says "Loan"
- **Defense angle:** Who typed this? Was Mohammad instructed?

### Invoice Response (Bilaga 6)
- Mohammad says he'll pay installment
- **Defense angle:** Could this be about a different obligation?

## WORST CASE SCENARIO

If court rules against defendants:
- Principal: 480,395 SEK
- Interest: ~61,240 SEK

- **Total exposure: ~600,000-650,000 SEK**

---

## RECOMMENDATION

Given the strength of plaintiff's documentary evidence (especially the handwritten note and "Lån" transfer), consider:

1. **Negotiate settlement** - Potentially for reduced amount
2. **Payment plan** - If full payment not possible
3. **Dispute interest** - May be able to reduce claimed amounts
4. **Challenge solidariskt** - Argue separate liability for Joumana's 30,000 SEK

⚠️ **STRONGLY RECOMMEND** engaging a Swedish lawyer for proper defense
