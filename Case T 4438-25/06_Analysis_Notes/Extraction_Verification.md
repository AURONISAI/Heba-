## Potential Issues/Questions for Review

1. **Page 2:** Interest rates appear to decrease over time (10.30% → 9.40%) - verify this matches actual bank rates
2. **Page 3:** Claim 3 interest amounts (January-June) - verify calculation method
3. **Page 4:** Reference to "s 6" (page 6) of Swedbank statement - we have this in Page 10
4. **Page 5:** Date discrepancy - "Den 25 november" but year not specified (context suggests 2024)
5. **Page 8:** Reference to "aktbilaga 16" with adjusted claims - this document not in first 10 pages
